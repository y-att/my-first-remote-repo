# My First Remote Repo

Another edit is being made to test the SSH protocol works so that I can avoid manually authenticating every single time.

This is my first remote repo.

It started life as a local git repository.

But you'll be able to read this on GitHub when we put it onto a GitHub remote!

This text is what I am going to add as a new change to be committed
